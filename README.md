# 🏀 Office Basketball Challenge — VR Game

A VR game set in an office environment. Pick up objects from around the room
and throw them into the basketball hoop using realistic velocity-based physics.
Built with **Godot 4** and **OpenXR**.

## Idea and Goal

The idea came from the classic office fantasy — throwing paper balls into a
trash bin (real talk). The goal of this project is to bring that experience into
VR with satisfying physical throwing mechanics.

The player stands in a virtual office and can grab various objects around the
room and hurl them into a basketball hoop. When the player releases the grip
button, the object inherits the exact speed and direction the controller was
moving at that moment — making every throw feel direct and physical.

This alpha prototype demonstrates the core interaction loop: **grab → aim →
throw → score** (k. without scores yet).

## Done

- [x] VR scene setup with OpenXR
- [x] Office environment — room, desk, basic props
- [x] Throwing mechanic
- [x] Grabbable objects system

## To Be Done

- [ ] Score detection on basketball hoop 
- [ ] Score counter UI visible in VR
- [ ] Sound effects (object pickup, throw, hit, score)
- [ ] Object respawn after each throw
- [ ] More grabbable object types and variety
- [ ] Improved office environment with additional props and detail

## Steps Completed

1. **OpenXR project setup** — configured Godot 4 project with OpenXR plugin,
set up the XR node tree for head and both hand controllers.
2. **Office scene** — built a basic enclosed office room with a desk as the main
interaction surface.
3. **Grabbable system** — implemented a grab mechanic tied to the controller
grip button; any tagged object in range can be picked up by either hand.
4. **Throwing** — on grip release, the held object receives the controller's
linear velocity, producing natural and responsive throws.
